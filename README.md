# RISCV port of the Slackware Distribution

This is my port of the Slackware Distribution for the RISCV ISA, following the slackware-current tree as close as posible.

The base for this is the stage4 from Fedora, which you can learn how to install and use with ease in this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/fede2cr/riscv_playground/blob/master/RISCV%20Qemu.ipynb) tutorial.

Once a working Slackware stage4 is completed:
- Complete recompile
- aaa_elflibs will be re-done
- Adding MANIFEST and .asc files

The graphical packages will be the last to get into the tree.

Feel free to submit any issues of parches/pull requests.
