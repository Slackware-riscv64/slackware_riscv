Some of the changes with the main Slackware distribution
--------------------------------------------------------

- In GCC, support for Ada is not ready yet, to there is not gcc-gnats package. Same for Go and Fortran.
  Some speed issues might arise from this warning while compiling GCC (needs research):
  "configure: WARNING: No native atomic operations are provided for this platform.
   configure: WARNING: They will be faked using a mutex.
   configure: WARNING: Performance of certain classes will degrade as a result"
- Rust is in early stages of port, so no rust package for the moment.
