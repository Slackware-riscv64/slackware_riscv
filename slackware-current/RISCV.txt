Some of the changes with the main Slackware distribution
--------------------------------------------------------

- In GCC, support for Ada is not ready yet, to there is not gcc-gnats package.
  Same for Go and Fortran.
  Some speed issues might arise from this warning while compiling GCC (needs 
  research):
  "configure: WARNING: No native atomic operations are provided for this platform.
   configure: WARNING: They will be faked using a mutex.
   configure: WARNING: Performance of certain classes will degrade as a result"
- Rust is in early stages of port, so no rust package for the moment.
- Findutils in versions 2.4.2 and 2.6.0 present a glib problem, documented in
  bug #2. While I find/make a patch, we'll use a version from Git.
- Upgraded a52dec to CVS version, for riscv64 support.
