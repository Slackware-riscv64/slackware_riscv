libtirpc: Linux. It is being developed by Bull GNU/Linux NFSv4 project.
libtirpc:
libtirpc: You will need this library if you plan to use RPC with a GLIBC
libtirpc: version newer than 2.13, because the RPC stack has been removed
libtirpc: from GLIBC versions newer than 2.13. The library is required
libtirpc: by the 'rpcbind' package.
