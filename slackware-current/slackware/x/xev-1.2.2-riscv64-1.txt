xev: xev (X11 event viewer)
xev:
xev: xev creates a window and then asks the X server to send it X11 events
xev: whenever anything happens to the window (such as it being moved,
xev: resized, typed in, clicked in, etc.).  You can also attach it to an
xev: existing window.  It is useful for seeing what causes events to occur
xev: and to display the information that they contain; it is essentially
xev: a debugging and development tool, and should not be needed in normal
xev: usage.
