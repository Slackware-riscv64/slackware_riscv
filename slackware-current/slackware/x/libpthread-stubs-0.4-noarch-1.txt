libpthread-stubs:
libpthread-stubs: This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided
libpthread-stubs: in libc or otherwise available by default. Libraries like libxcb rely
libpthread-stubs: on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe
libpthread-stubs: when linked to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when
libpthread-stubs: running single-threaded.
