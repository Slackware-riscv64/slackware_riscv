bdftopcf: Fonts in Portable Compiled Format can be read by any architecture,
bdftopcf: although the file is structured to allow one particular architecture
bdftopcf: to read them directly without reformatting.  This allows fast reading
bdftopcf: on the appropriate machine, but the files are still portable (but
bdftopcf: read more slowly) on other machines.
