mtdev: mtdev (multitouch device library)
mtdev:
mtdev: mtdev is a stand-alone library which transforms all variants of
mtdev: kernel MT events to the slotted type B protocol.  The events put
mtdev: into mtdev may be from any MT device, specifically type A without
mtdev: contact tracking, type A with contact tracking, or type B with
mtdev: contact tracking.
mtdev: The bulk of the mtdev code has been out there since 2008 as part of
mtdev: the Multitouch X Driver.  With this package, finger tracking and 
mtdev: seamless MT protocol handling is available under a free license.
