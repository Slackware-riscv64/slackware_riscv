xcb-proto: xcb-proto (X protocol C-language Binding protocol descriptions)
xcb-proto:
xcb-proto: xcb-proto provides the XML-XCB protocol descriptions that libxcb
xcb-proto: uses to generate the majority of its code and API. We provide them
xcb-proto: separately from libxcb to allow reuse by other projects, such as
xcb-proto: additional language bindings, protocol dissectors, or documentation
xcb-proto: generators.
